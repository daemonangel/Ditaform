Ditaform has the following features:
- New: opens a new copy of the form.
- Open: opens a previously saved form.
- Save: saves the form. 
- Save As: saves the form with a new name.
- Close: exits Ditaform.
- Languages > Edit: selects translation languages

Text highlighting:
- Yellow text indicates a draft comment
- Blue text indicates translated content
- Purple text indicates dependencies

Creating DITA content:
- Add a unique props attribute to all blocks of content. 
  Each props name becomes a selectable row in Ditaform. You can add multiple blocks of content to a row by tagging them with the same props attribute.
- Add variables
  - In topics, use the following format: <ph keyref="variable-name"></ph>
  - In the map, use the following format to define the variable:
    <keydef keys="variable-name">
      <topicmeta>
        <keywords>
          <keyword>[sample value]</keyword>
        </keywords>
      </topicmeta>
    </keydef>
- A ditaval file containing all props names is automatically generated when you save in Ditaform.

Troubleshooting:
- Checkboxes and editable text boxes highlighted in yellow indicate an error. Check notes in that row for more information.
- Text not inside a block element may not format correctly. Wrap oddly formatted text in a paragraph element.
- Any content not tagged with a props attribute will not display in Ditaform.
- Avoid nesting blocks of content tagged with a props attribute. It may cause content to be duplicated in the form.
