      <title>Reducing RF Exposure â€“ Use Properly</title>
      <p>Only operate the device in accordance with the instructions supplied.</p>
      <p>The device complies with internationally recognized standards covering human exposure to electromagnetic fields. For information on international human exposure to electromagnetic fields, refer to the Zebra Declaration of Conformity (DoC) at www.zebra.com/doc.</p>
      <p>Use only Zebra tested and approved headset, belt-clips, holsters, and similar accessories to ensure RF exposure compliance. If applicable, follow the instructions for use as detailed in the accessory guide.</p>
      <p>The use of third-party belt clips, holsters, and similar accessories may not comply with RF exposure compliance requirements and should be avoided.</p>
      <p>For further information on the safety of RF energy from wireless devices, refer to RF exposure and assessment standards section at www.zebra.com/responsibility.</p>
